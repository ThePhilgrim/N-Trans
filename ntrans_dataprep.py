This script requires BNC (British National Corpus) to be downloaded to the local
system.

The full version of BNC can be downloaded from the Oxford Text Archive (538.35 MB):
http://www.ota.ox.ac.uk/desc/2554

Unzip BNC to the working directory, and rename the folder `BNC`.

NOTE: The BNC contains around 112M words (or 6M+ sentences).
It can take around 1,5 hours to run this script.

The script generates 237M N-grams.
