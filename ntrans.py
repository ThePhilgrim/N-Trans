One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like
back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
